# Predicting_Engagement

## Introduction

In recent years, social networks have played an increasing role in our daily lives. The social network has become a priority for brand marketing, with Instagram being a platform with one of the highest engagement rates. The data from these networks can be useful for other things, too. This study[https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e12554/] uses publicly available data from Reddit to examine the effectiveness of different methods that can provide an early detection of major depressive disorders (MDDs).\n
The objectives of this project are to visualize my social network, applying graph theory to better understand it and to create a model that will predict the engagement level of a post.
