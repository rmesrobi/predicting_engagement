# Predicting_Engagement

## Introduction

Social networks play an increasing role in our daily lives. They have become a priority for brand marketing, with Instagram being a platform with one of the highest engagement rates. The data from these networks can be useful for other things, too. As an example, [this study](https://www.jmir.org/2019/6/e12554/) used data from Reddit to examine the effectiveness of different methods that can provide an early detection of major depressive disorders (MDDs). The objective of this project is to visualize my social network, applying graph theory to better understand it and to create a multi-input model that will predict the engagement of a post.\
